# Contributing to Kibble #

_This document is a work in progress!_

The main development and design discussion happens on our mailing lists.
We have a list specifically for development, and one for future user questions and feedback.

To join in the discussion on the design and roadmap, you can send an email to [dev@kibble.apache.org](mailto:dev@kibble.apache.org).<br/>
You can subscribe to the list by sending an email to [dev-subscribe@kibble.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@kibble.apache.org).<br/>
You can also browse the archives online at [lists.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@kibble.apache.org).

We also have an IRC channel, #kibble on [Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#kibble)
